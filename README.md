# 🌊 Water Life Cycle – Interactive Dashboard
🔗 **[Live Project Link]([https://app.powerbi.com/your-live-dashboard-link-here](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Contests-Gallery/Water-Life-Cycle/td-p/4611138))**  

📌 **Project Overview**  
This interactive Power BI dashboard explores the **entire Water Life Cycle**, from evaporation to runoff and collection. Using real-world datasets, it visualizes precipitation trends, groundwater infiltration, pollution from runoff, and sustainable conservation strategies. The project highlights how water moves through different stages of the environment while raising awareness about global freshwater scarcity.  

---

## 🧩 Dataset  
The project integrates multiple datasets, including:  
- NASA & NOAA climate data (evaporation, precipitation, cloud formation)  
- Global International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGB) water use data  
- U.S. Geological Survey groundwater contamination statistics  
- Weather API data for precipitation and cloud coverage  
- Environmental reports on pollution and runoff  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Visualize each stage of the water cycle with real-world environmental data  
- Track **freshwater vs. saltwater availability** across the globe  
- Show trends in **groundwater use and contamination**  
- Highlight sustainable practices for reducing water waste and pollution  
- Raise awareness about water scarcity and conservation strategies  

---

## 🧠 Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards & KPI visualizations  
- **DAX & Power Query** – Data modeling, transformations, and cleaning  
- **Weather & Climate APIs** – Integrated for precipitation and atmospheric data  
- **Excel & CSV files** – Used for baseline data storage and preprocessing  
- **Business Intelligence** – Trend analysis, environmental storytelling, sustainability insights  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- 🌍 **97% of Earth’s water is saltwater**, with only **2% freshwater**, most locked in ice caps.  
- 💧 Global freshwater use has increased **6x since 1900**, largely due to agriculture and industry.  
- ☁️ Clouds generated by evaporation hold more water energy than nuclear bombs.  
- 🚰 In Michigan, **766 million gallons of groundwater** are used daily, with rising PFAS contamination risks.  
- 🏙️ Runoff pollution is heavily influenced by urban infrastructure and agriculture, showing spikes in ammonium levels in several countries.  
- 🌧️ Rainfall patterns (2020–2025) reveal high variability, stressing the need for sustainable water planning.
